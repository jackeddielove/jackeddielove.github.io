                    <p>"I highly recommend Jack Love as a math tutor for young students. His ability to tailor lessons to each student's unique learning style ensures they not only grasp key mathematical concepts but also develop a genuine interest in the subject. Jack introduces creative problem-solving approaches beyond traditional school methods, helping students gain a deeper, more flexible understanding and appreciation of mathematics."

                <div class="content">
                    <p>I define math outreach as:</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: 600;">The endeavor to create positive mathematical experiences for others.</p>
                    <p>I don't think that everyone needs to love math. I don't even think that mathematics is all that useful to most of us.</p>
                    <p>I do think that math is misunderstood and underappreciated as a creative practice, and I do outreach to grow that understanding and appreciation in others.</p>
                    <p>I do this by offering fun, engaging presentations and activities for K-12 classrooms, teacher development days, and any other spaces of learning and curiosity.</p>
                    <p>All activities are designed to be "low-floor/high-ceiling", meaning they are both accessible and challenging to any level of student.</p>
